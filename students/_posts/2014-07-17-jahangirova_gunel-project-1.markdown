description:The oracle problem remains one of the key challenges in software testing,  for  which  little  automated  support  has  been  developed  so far. The  effectiveness  of  a  test  case  in  revealing  software faults depends  critically  on  the  quality  of  the  oracle.My  research is focused on the automated assessment and improvement of the oracle quality.The  techniques  proposed combinetest  case  generation  to reveal false positives, mutation testing to reveal false negatives and identification  of  the  program  points  for  internal  oracle  placement, which has the highest fault finding capability
