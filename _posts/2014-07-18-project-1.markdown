description: The oracle problem remains one of the key challenges in software testing,for which little automated support has been developed so 
far. The effectiveness of a test case in revealing software faults depends critically on the quality of the oracle. My research is focused on the 
automated assessment and improvement of the oracle quality. The technique proposed combine test case generation to reveal false positives,  mutation testing to reveal false negatives and identification of the program points for  internal  oracle  placement, which has the highest fault-finding capability.
